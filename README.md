Understanding Cookie Stealing and Prevention

This project aims to demonstrate how cookies can be stolen and how to protect against such attacks.

# Cookie Stealing

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's computer by a website. They are used to maintain user sessions, track preferences, and personalize the user experience. However, cookies can also be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

Common Cookie Stealing Techniques:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Involves injecting malicious script into a vulnerable website.
When a user visits the compromised website, the script executes and can steal cookies.
Example (simplified):
JavaScript
```
<script>
    document.cookie = "stolen_cookie=" + document.cookie;
</script>
```
Use code with caution.

Session Hijacking:

Involves stealing a valid session ID to impersonate a user.
Can be achieved through network sniffing, brute-forcing, or social engineering.
Example (using Python's requests library):
Python
import requests
```
session_id = "stolen_session_id"
headers = {"Cookie": f"session_id={session_id}"}
response = requests.get("https://target_website.com/protected_page", headers=headers)
```
Use code with caution.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:

Involves intercepting communication between a user and a website.
Can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.
Cookie Protection

# To protect against cookie stealing:

Use HTTPS: Encrypts communication between the browser and the server, making it harder for attackers to intercept cookies.
Set HttpOnly and Secure Flags: Prevents client-side scripts from accessing cookies and ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
Limit Cookie Lifetime: Reduce the exposure window for stolen cookies.
Implement Strong Password Policies: Makes it harder for attackers to gain access to accounts even if cookies are stolen.
Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification.
Keep Software Updated: Fixes vulnerabilities that could be exploited for cookie stealing.
